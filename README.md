# Moodfy - A Mobile App for Android

Love Spotify? But are pre-made mood playlists just not doing it for you? Do you want to have more control over what songs should be in your own mood playlist but without the hassle of manually creating a new playlist and adding songs to it, only for that playlist to get lost in your library’s depths later? That’s where Moodfy comes in. This is the app where mood meets music.

You can listen to Spotify just like you always do and if a song arises which makes you feel a certain emotion, then you can easily add it to a playlist using the handy Moodfy bubble. Once the Moodfy bubble has been activated, it can float on top of your Spotify, not interrupting your music streaming session. If a song comes on which makes you feel a certain mood, then you can simply expand the Moodfy bubble to show you the 10 pre-defined mood tags.
Then with a simple click on the chosen mood tag, Moodfy will take care of the rest of the process for you. If the mood playlist hasn’t been created yet, then it will be automatically created for you and the song added to it. The playlist will be saved onto Spotify itself, but it will also be stored inside the Moodfy app. This means that you will never lose track of your mood playlists under the sheer number of playlists that your Spotify library can acquire.
To get started, simply allow the app access to your Spotify account and then tap the button in ‘Mood Music’ to start Moodfying your music.

OTHER FEATURES
Works with both Spotify Free and Spotify Premium accounts.
You don’t need to be listening to Spotify on your phone to use Moodfy, as long as you are playing music from one of your devices while using the app (e.g., laptop, tablet, iPad, etc).
